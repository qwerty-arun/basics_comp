# Computer Registers
Type of computer memory used to quickly accept, store and transfer data and instructions that are being used immediately by the CPU. </br>

Registers used by CPU are often termed as Processor Registers. </br>A process register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any data.

Computer needs processor registers for manipulating data and a register for holding a memory address. </br>
The register holding the memory location is used to calculate the address of the next instruction after the execution of the current instruction is completed.

## Most Common Registers used:
- Data Register DR
- Address Register AR 
- Accumulator AC
- Instruction Register IR
- Program Counter PC
- Temporary Register TR
- Input Register INP
- Output Register OUTPR

DR holds memory operand, AR holds address for the memory, AC is a processor register, IR holds instruction code, PC holds address of the instruction and TR holds temporary data.
